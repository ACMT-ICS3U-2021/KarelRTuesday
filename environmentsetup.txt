To set up the environment to run programs from default

The environment variables must be at least
-I ".:../karel"

To run from karel use
-I "."

$graphical can be true or false to define which type of world will be used (default is true)
  Set it true or false before you require_relative anything such as ur_robot. 

$tracing can be true or false. In a non-graphical world, when it is true, each robot action will be printed on console

If $graphical is false, you can just put any task into the main task block

If $graphical is true, you need to create a window. One way is (assuming method task is defined):

if __FILE__ == $0
  window(8, 40).run do #parameters are size and speed
    task()
  end
end

Note that you should create the window before you reference the world. 
If you need to reference the world before the task block see pg14.rb to see how
